This is an informal document to jot down development thoughts and ideas.

* Considering moving to [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching model. The one we're currently
using is based on what I do at my day job, but is designed for complex systems, and may be unnecessarily complicated 
for such a small, greenfield project.

* Future direction of project may be to conceive of TimeSeries object as a reactive stream, and the current fixed and immutable
implementation as a sample from such a stream. This actually fits better with the textbook definition of a time series
as a realization of an infinite stochastic process.
